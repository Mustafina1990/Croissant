        <h1>What is a Croissant?</h1>
        <p>A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal levels of salt, yeast and sugar.1 The texture and eating quality of croissants are created:
            <ul class="type">
                <li>Lamination: a folding process creates alternating dough and fat layers</li>
                <li>Expansion: caused by the leavening action of yeast fermentation, and physical separation of the dough and fat layers during the oven spring stage of baking as the water trapped between them vaporizes to steam.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
